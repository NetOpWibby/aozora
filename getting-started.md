# Getting Started

## Goals, scope and literature 

See the original [Goals and Scope document](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community/flow/-/blob/main/original-goals-and-scope.md) that Twitter vetted (note that Identity and Social Graph Portability are the two initial goals now)

You can also read the [original literature list](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community/flow/-/blob/main/Literature.md) provided.  For newer links browse thru [TOPICS](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community/flow/-/tree/main/TOPICS)

Jay Graber of the Bluesky organization has [written a conceptual framework of the self-certified web](https://jaygraber.medium.com/web3-is-self-certifying-9dad77fd8d81)

## How To Contribute

1) The simplest first way to contribute is to try out code or apps from [blueskycommunity.net](https://blueskycommunity.net), and report in [#in-the-wild](https://discord.gg/9KzA2frh6d)!  

2) Become a Topic editor!  Maintain Markdown docs pinned in each channel with key links (ask a moderator for perms)

3) Join a Working Group - check out the discussions in the discord, or look through [working groups](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community/flow/-/tree/main/WORKING_GROUPS).  You can [form your own group](https://discord.gg/UU4jBPKBm8) as well!

4) Pop in to a discussion or offer to sync up - see the [bluesky-community circle](https://join.whatscookin.us/circle/bluesky-community)
You can make offers here, and plan them when someone is interested in joining you.


## Structure

The idea is that discussion happens in the discord, and design, docs or key links that crystalize out should be checked into this repo in the corresponding directory.
