# Regulatory Concerns for Decentralized Systems

Notes
- we should consider both federated and p2p
  - Need to determine what the distinction is.

## Purpose

The goal of this document is to identify regulatory concerns for
operators of self-hosted, federated services that fall under
consideration of the BlueSky project.

With increasing pushes by governments (at regional, national, state or
local levels) to deal with issues that arise from the greater access
people have to each other, we are seeing more regulations being
proposed and implemented that have the potential to damage the ability
of operators of small services to engage fully on the internet.

Some examples of regulations include:
- Privacy laws
- Anti-terrorism laws
- Laws seeking to deal with the production and distribution of child
  sexual abuse material
- Laws seeking to deal with other forms of abuse (for example
  non-consensual image sharing, hate and incitement to hatred, racism,
  anti-trans, mysogeny, etc.)
- Laws governing lese majeste and seeking to protect politicians and
  other public figures from scrutiny and criticism.
- [Please add others]


Some examples of challenges that operators of federated nodes could
face:
- Speech that is legal in the country where a posting is made may be
  illegal in the country it is served from when viewed by a user on a
  separate node.
- A posting may be required to be taken down within a period of time
  that is not possible for the operator to perform (e.g. operator is
  asleep and won't get the demand to take the posting down within the
  hour, the operator is overseas and can't get access to the service
  for some time).
- A user may require a copy of all the data that relates to them and
  the operator doesn't know how to extract that copy and send it to
  the user.

There are many more, these are just a sample.

The BlueSky project could be a means to gather the potential concerns
that operators of decentralised and federated nodes may have in terms
of meeting regulatory obligations, and it could prepare some material
that is accessible to these operators on how to meet these
obligations.
