### Why Are We Here?

_originally posted to the private gitlab for bluesky community in March 2020_

Specifically, why are we here in a group trying to form some sort of organization called 'bluesky' that may be initially funded by Twitter, but not owned or directed by Twitter.
Why this particular group?  What value can it bring?

#### What is the value of Bluesky to Twitter?

Twitter has 4900 employees, including some of the top engineers in silicon valley.  If Twitter just needed to do some research about decentralized protocols, pick the best ones and decide how to use them for their next phase of development, they probably have some people who could do that - or could easily hire a top quality team to do it.  So while hopefully we all bring some good skills and knowledge to the table, engineering capability isn't something that Twitter can't do as well or better.

The one thing that Bluesky can do better than Twitter, is to not be Twitter. 

Why is this valuable?  One answer is in light of the paper [Credible Neutrality As A Guiding Principle](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/) - the importance of credible neutrality and legitimacy in any governance mechanism or broad cooperative effort.  If Twitter just picks a set of protocols - even widely compatible decentralized ones - then right off the bat parts of the community - especially those not picked - may see this as some form of bias or attempt to gain a benefit, and not wish to cooperate with the effort.  And it should be mentioned, that many players felt burned by the previous open APIs that were then closed off.  

Fundamentally, anything clearly under the direct control of a single player is not the best way to start off decentralization.

However, if a group of 5-20 people handpicked by Twitter make such a selection, the result is not very different.

This small group, therefore, should probably not assume that we ourselves are going to make the decision right now about specifically which protocol to use and specifically what the design will be, even if we are pretty sure we know the right answers.

What can our group that leverages our role as not-Twitter?  

* pull in more community members, and reach out to all the existing Twitter-alternatives to ask _their_ pain points as well as Twitter's; 
* lay the groundwork for how the organization itself will be formed that allows new stakeholders to genuinely have a say in direction and control (but is resistant to hostile takeover)
* see if we can design a minimum specification that allows for an ecosystem of survival of the fittest rather than survival of the first, so that the different candidates for decentralized protocols and identity can actually interact and grow naturally without forcing users onto a specific one

### Survival of the Fittest, not Survival of the First

This is a key point and deserves its own section.  Why are Twitter and Facebook so dominant in social media?  Are their interfaces and algorithms so much better than any competitor?  Or do people just go there because people are there?   Clearly, the latter has a great deal to do with it.  Marc Andreessen may have best explained Network Effects, where the network becomes more valuable to users as more people use it - and companies try to protect their networks as a competitive advantage. But if all of the networks are connected, then the players must compete on other factors, like quality of content or experience.

Thus, connecting all the existing networks together and allowing new small players to easily join, is of fundamental value even if the underlying protocols are bridged and ugly and not as secure as we'd like.  Just the fact that we can get all the users talking (and somehow solve the majority of the security issues), allows new players to evolve and grow organically.
    
### What is the value of Bluesky to the larger community?

Perhaps one question is, why should the community trust Bluesky any more than it would trust Twitter?  What will it be about the Bluesky entity that makes it one that say, the ActivityPub community would want to cooperate with, given that they felt perhaps overlooked in the original tweet?  Does this matter?  

Creating a bare minimum of effort to be "doing bluesky" that is as inclusive as possible, might be one factor. 

Showing a strong dedication to outreach and inclusivity on multiple levels, in the sense of asking groups 'what would it take for you to join this ecosystem?'   (A group for this purpose can be a group of developers or a platform with a group of end users.)  

Having some kind of innovative governance model - maybe checks and balances between a board and a tokenized credit system for contributors, maybe stock warrants to ensure real ownership by all developers who contribute, maybe some democratic work-weighted mechanisms for decision making - could bring people in.  It might also turn people away if it seems too heavyweight or risky, of course.

One value that may be overlooked, is in trying to form consensus while NOT being a heavy hitter.

If @jack came up with an idea that had questionable value and expressed it, it would cost him credibility. And on the other hand if as a practical joke he made a completely nonsensical proposal, many people would still spend many man-hours trying to figure it out.  For a person with high credibility weight to say something experimental, actually has a higher cost than someone with less credibility.

If some random person has a questionable idea that appears not sensible, it has very little cost to either them or the community, simply because no one will pay attention to it.  By having a group that is not all that well known, the only way for ideas to get traction is by their own utility.  

However if a random person has a really good idea, it still takes a lot of effort to prove it and to get anyone to pay attention.  Perhaps there is a 'goldilocks' level of credibility: one wants the feeling that maybe these guys have some force behind them, worth giving a few minutes of time to consider and if it looks good maybe work with it, but if it doesn't make sense don't bother with it.

The hope is that the unique composition of bluesky will lead to its core value: one or more levels of a decentralized protocol that is adopted because of its genuine utility.  

### What is the value of Bluesky to the participants?   

Outside of the 5-person paid team, why would developers and platforms and new users join the bluesky ecosystem?  

* access to a larger public conversation (potentially including some or all of Twitter's users)
 
* ability to influence the direction of decentralized communication
 
* access to reputation systems and algorithms as those evolve
 
* ability to launch a startup with only a user interface, and still allow people to use it to talk in the public conversation
 
* ability to customize one's own 'public conversation experience'
 
* if an inclusive ownership model is adopted, perhaps economic incentives of working on the reference application and gaining a stake in something with momentum
 
* for people who have already invested a lot into a particular platform or development track, to stay relevent and not lose the work they have already put in
 
* excitement about the potential for transforming the public space
 
 At least, these reasons or some others were enough to cause this small initial group to make concerted effort so far.
