# bluesky community repo

Markdown docs per discord channel, working group and topic files

## TOPICS

please create a subdirectory per topic channel

the README.md for each topic should be pinned and put into the channel description in the discord

either in the README.md or in a link to EXISTING.md, we would like to have a maintained list of existing solutions in each topic in a fixed format.  The current template is

```
name (of existing solution): [keybase, pgp, oauth etc] 
underlying tech: [blockchain, keypairs, etc]
used-by: [fediverse, ssb, twitter, etc]
approx num users: [+/- order of magnitude]
how-to-use: [can it be used by other stacks/platforms?  how?]
reasons: [for use/not use]
requests: [what would be good to do next with this method]
``` 

Users may also upload other docs for discussion, as PRs are a nice place to make inline comments.

## WORKING GROUPS

please create a subdirectory for each working group

The README.md for each working group should contain :

```
Lead: 
Contact methods: (if not only discord)
Description of group:

Next goals - either link to [Taiga](http://taiga.whatscookin.us/project/bluesky-community/kanban) task/epics or include in the markdown, a list of

Deliverable:
ETA:
Assignee:

```

Stale goals may be removed, and stale working groups may be archived.

Please upload other documents that are needed to support the goals.  If you find gitlab too cumbersome leave some breadcrumbs in the readme to your preferred method.


## ECOSYSTEM

This area does not require repo pages, as each app/protocol generally has its own external home page that can be put in the channel description.

## ONBOARDING

What type of role or category do you fall into? This will help you take an action that is helpful to you and everyone:

User Story:

 - I want to pitch my project/protocol to the BlueSky community
   - Submit yourself to the next(s) panel discussion.
   - Submit a CodeLab/other tutorial
 - I am an intern looking to help teams that align with my values
   - Look at this list of project summaries and try their tutorial
     - Try another, or join!
 - I do not have time, I no longer have ego attached to projects, Iâ€™m an expert to help consult and give war stories
   - Personal backchannels with them and connecting teams.
 - I want to hear nuanced discussions around important design decisions/ features related to decentralized social networks.
   - Submit your topic/ potential panelists for the next panel discussion.
